# My Leadership Readme

## My leadership philosophy

My ultimate goal is to help you unlock the potential you already have inside; to bring clarity and context to the work we're doing. 

I'll invest heavily in our relationship to build trust. I'll move between giving you the guidance and feedback you need to grow and giving you the space and autonomy you'll need to execute and do the best work of your career.

I believe in setting clear goals and expectations with you so that we never have to guess on where we stand or how we're doing. I'll ask lots of questions (sometimes tough questions) to help us trigger reflection.

## My answers to our first 1:1 questions <sup>[1](https://larahogan.me/blog/first-one-on-one-questions/)</sup>

### What makes you grumpy?
**1. When I see a lack of ownership and/or bias towards action.**  
If you're not sure who the DRI is it's probably you. If you're not sure what next steps are then ask. In short, push things forward, make it happen. Take the time to identify the destination; but once the destination is known be relentless in getting there as fast as you can. 

**2. Lazy thinking or default answers**  
It's fine to do something because that's how it's been done or that's how Company X does it. But first understand the nuance and why it's done that way. Best encapsulated by "The young person knows the rules but the old person knows the exceptions."

**3. Inattention to detail, lack of craft**  
I want the people on my team to sweat the details. Your internal bar should be higher than those around you.

### How will someone else know when you're grumpy?
I've been told [I wear my emotions on my sleeve](https://idioms.thefreedictionary.com/wear+on+sleeve). If we're in a group setting I'll contribute less or be a little more withdrawn (I'm working on this). If we're on a 1:1, I'll be direct though and let you know I'm grumpy. ðŸ™‚ 

### How can someone else help you when you're grumpy?
If I don't bring it up or mention it, I'd truly love it if you'd say something. Tackling the issue head on with a nudge or thoughtful conversation usually helps. 

### In what medium (Slack, email, in person, etc.) do you prefer to receive feedback?
I love feedback. It's a gift. When receiving it, my preference in order of medium is:  
In person > Zoom > Phone > Slack > Email. 

### When do you prefer to receive feedback? (routine like in 1:1s, or as-it-happens)
As it happens. Please don't wait to bring it up if you can help it. A quick Zoom or Slack message is much preferred to waiting until the next time we meet. It will help me internalize the feedback and focus on the specific action (or inaction) at hand. 

### How do you prefer to receive praise? (Public or private)
Public! 

### What makes 1:1s the most valuable for you?
1:1's are most valuable for me when you take an active role in them. Treat this like your meeting. Use our time together to surface challenges you're facing, be open and honest about how you're doing, where you need help, and where you want to go.

## My expectations of folks who report to me

**I expect you to:**

- Invest in our 1:1s. Be prepared each week and give them your full attention and focus.
- Challenge my ideas directly and openly. Tell me when I'm wrong â€“ it happens a lot.
- Practice [disagreeing, sharing, and committing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disagree_and_commit). Don't skip the _sharing_ part. 
- Never stop learning and honing your craft. This includes design _and_ communication. 
- Understand how the work we do supports our customer's and our company's goals.
- Speak up whenever something feels off.
- Try to leave your ego at the door and separate your ideas from yourself / identity as as designer.


## What you can expect of me as your manager

**You can expect:**

- Weekly 1:1s with me. I think this time is incredibly valuable and I'll aim to never miss one. 
- Clarity around purpose and goals so it's always clear what's expected of you and what good performance looks like. 
- No surprises. I'll let you know when you're doing well and when there's room to improve. I'll do this regularly, and not just once or twice a year in a perf review. 
- I will challenge you to grow and do the best work of your career and work hard to build an environment that makes that possible. 
- I promise to deeply invest in your success and do everything I can to unlock opportunities for you here _and_ wherever you head next. 

## About me (and my cheat sheetâ€¦)
Here's largely how I view the world boiled down into a few bullet points. No, it's not complete or all encompassing, but I hope it gives a foundation to start our new relationship from. 

- I default to trust and assume best intent. 
- I value relationships over transactions. 
- I'm a pragmatist in the purest sense. 
- I seek forgiveness over asking for permission. 
- I have many [strong opinions, weakly held](https://www.saffo.com/02008/07/26/strong-opinions-weakly-held/). 
- I respect those that challenge my ideas openly and directly.
- I believe in reasoning empirically and from [first principles](https://jamesclear.com/first-principles).
- I'm on the Ask end of [Ask vs Guess culture](https://slackhq.com/ask-vs-guess-culture-in-the-office) spectrum. 
- I'm currently an [ENTJ](https://www.16personalities.com/entj-personality) and an [Enneagram 7, wing 8](https://www.enneagraminstitute.com/type-7).
