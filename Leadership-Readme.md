# My Leadership Readme

## My leadership philosophy

My ultimate goal is to help you unlock the potential you already have inside; to bring clarity and context to the work we‚Äôre doing. 

I‚Äôll invest heavily in our relationship to build trust. I‚Äôll move between giving you the guidance and feedback you need to grow and giving you the space and autonomy you‚Äôll need to execute and do the best work of your career.

I believe in setting clear goals and expectations with you so that we never have to guess on where we stand or how we‚Äôre doing. I‚Äôll ask lots of questions (sometimes tough questions) to help us trigger reflection.

## My answers to our first 1:1 questions <sup>[1](https://larahogan.me/blog/first-one-on-one-questions/)</sup>

### What makes you grumpy?
**1. When I see a lack of ownership and/or bias towards action.**  
If you're not sure who the DRI is it's probably you. If you're not sure what next steps are then ask. In short, push things forward, make it happen. Take the time to indentify the destination; but once the destination is known be relentless in getting there as fast as you can. 

**2. Lazy thinking or default answers**  
It's fine to do something because that's how it's been done or that's how Company X does it. But first understand the nuance and why it's done that way. Best encapsulated by ‚ÄúThe young person knows the rules but the old person knows the exceptions.‚Äù

**3. Innattention to detail, lack of craft**  
I expect the people on my team to sweat the details. Your internal bar should be higher than those around you.

### How will someone else know when you‚Äôre grumpy?
I‚Äôve been told [I wear my emotions on my sleeve](https://idioms.thefreedictionary.com/wear+on+sleeve). If we‚Äôre in a group setting I'll contribute less or withdrawl (I'm working on this). If we‚Äôre on a 1:1, I‚Äôll be direct and let you know I‚Äôm grumpy. üôÇ 

### How can someone else help you when you‚Äôre grumpy?
If I don‚Äôt bring it up or mention it, I‚Äôd truly love it if you'd say something. Tackling the issue head on with a nudge or thoughtful conversation usually helps. 

### In what medium (Slack, email, in person, etc.) do you prefer to receive feedback?
I love feedback. It's a gift. When receeiving it, my preference in order of medium is:  
In person > Zoom > Phone > Slack > Email. 

### When do you prefer to receive feedback? (routine like in 1:1s, or as-it-happens)
As it happens. Please don‚Äôt wait to bring it up if you can help it. A quick Zoom or Slack message is much preferred to waiting until the next time we meet. It will help me internalize the feedback and focus on the specific action (or inaction) at hand. 

### How do you prefer to receive praise? (Public or private)
Public! 

### What makes 1:1s the most valuable for you?
1:1‚Äôs are most valuable for me when you take an active role in them. This is your meeting as much as mine. Use our time together to surface challenges you‚Äôre facing, be open and honest about how you‚Äôre doing, where you need help, and where you want to go. 

### What are your work goals for the next 3 months? Next 12 months? 
**Short term: **
- Establish a well oiled product & design machine üí™
- Get ahead of our Eng counterparts on future design and product specs
- Get to a 1.0 version of our design system (in Figma _and_ code)

**Longer term: **
- Design a world-class product. Tell the world about it. 
- Make room for vision prototyping. Show the future, others will follow. 
- Set the foundation for future PLG motion. Simplify UX, make it self serve. 


### What do you need from your manager?
Clarity on our mid-term goals, the trust, space, and autonomy to execute on those goals, and clear, candid, and direct feedback on my progress towards those goals.

I especially need to know and trust that they have thought more about where we're headed than I have üòÅ. 

### What do you need from your team?
Please speak up whenever you‚Äôre feeling challenged, stressed, anxious, unclear or have an issue. Having a solution in mind is great, but know that I don‚Äôt expect it. It‚Äôs okay not to have all the answers. It‚Äôs not okay though to let issues build and go unaddressed. 

Challenge my ideas directly and openly. Tell me when I‚Äôm wrong ‚Äì it happens a lot. I understand this will feel uncomfortable at first, but I‚Äôll do my best to let you know how much it‚Äôs appreciated. 

### What do you need from your peers? (outside the team)
Help surface problems or challenges you think myself or my team may be able to help you with. 

Be open to having ideas challenged and debated. Design + Product in particular is often about finding and solving ambiguous problems. To be effective, that often means asking lots of questions to form a strong understanding first.

Involve me/us as early in the process as you can. I promise to work hard to avoid adding any [stop energy](https://stories.buffer.com/forward-motion-stop-energy-at-startups-c01624b7989) to your project or initiative. 

## My expectations of folks who report to me

**I expect you to:**

- Invest in our 1:1s. Be prepared each week and give them your full attention and focus.
- Challenge my ideas directly and openly. Tell me when I‚Äôm wrong ‚Äì it happens a lot. Yes, I‚Äôm repeating myself here because I think it‚Äôs that important. 
- Practice [disagreeing and committing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disagree_and_commit).
- Never stop learning and honing your craft. This includes design _and_ communication. 
- Understand how the work we do supports our customer‚Äôs and our comapny's goals.
- Speak up whenever something feels off.
- Check your ego at the door and separate your ideas from yourself.


## What you can expect of me as your manager

**You can expect:**

- Weekly 1:1s with me. I think this time is incredibly valuable and I‚Äôll aim to never miss one. 
- Clarity around goals. I promise to set goals with you, so it‚Äôs always clear what‚Äôs expected of you and what good performance looks like. 
- No surprises. I‚Äôll let you know when you‚Äôre doing well and when there‚Äôs room to improve. I‚Äôll do this regularly, not just once or twice a year in a review, and I‚Äôll be specific. 
- I will challenge you to grow and do the best work of your career. 
- I promise to deeply invest in your success and do everything I can to unlock opportunities for you here and elsewhere. 

## About me (and my cheat sheet‚Ä¶)
Here's largely how I view the world boiled down into a few bullet points. No, it's not complete or all encompassing, but I hope it gives a foundation to start our new relationship from.

- I‚Äôm currently an [ENTJ](https://www.16personalities.com/entj-personality) and an [Enneagram 7, wing 8](https://www.enneagraminstitute.com/type-7).
