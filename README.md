# My Leadership Readme

## My leadership philosophy

My ultimate goal is to help you unlock the potential you already have inside; to bring clarity and context to the work we’re doing. 

I’ll invest heavily in our relationship to build trust. I’ll move between giving you the guidance and feedback you need to grow and giving you the space and autonomy you’ll need to execute and do the best work of your career.

I believe in setting clear goals and expectations with you so that we never have to guess on where we stand or how we’re doing. I’ll ask lots of questions (sometimes tough questions) to help us trigger reflection.


## My answers to our first 1:1 questions <sup>[1](https://larahogan.me/blog/first-one-on-one-questions/)</sup>

What makes you grumpy?
It may sound silly, but at the the root of many things that make me grumpy is inefficiency (see the note on my index card below about pragmatism and Ask vs Guess culture). 

**For example:**

- **Clarity** – when it’s not clear where our time can be best spent (and we feel like we’re floating). 
- **Initiative** – when we fail to take the initiative to push projects or tasks forward, or speak up (often waiting on others or thinking “that’s not my job”). 
- **Candor** – when progress can’t be made because we’re afraid to be honest, unreserved or transparent.


### How will someone else know when you’re grumpy?
I’ve been told [I wear my emotions on my sleeve](https://idioms.thefreedictionary.com/wear+on+sleeve). If we’re in a group setting I may be more reserved or contribute less. If we’re on a 1:1, I’ll be direct and let you know I’m grumpy. 🙂 

### How can someone else help you when you’re grumpy?
If I don’t bring it up or mention it, I’d truly love it if you would reach out and say something. Tackling the issue head on with a nudge or thoughtful conversation usually helps. 

### In what medium (Slack, email, in person, etc.) do you prefer to receive feedback?
In person > Zoom > Phone > Slack > Email.

### When do you prefer to receive feedback? (routine like in 1:1s, or as-it-happens)
As it happens. Please don’t wait to bring it up if you can help it. A quick Zoom or Slack message is much preferred to waiting until the next time we meet. It will help me internalize the feedback and focus on the specific action (or inaction) at hand. 

### How do you prefer to receive praise? (Public or private)
Public! 

### What makes 1:1s the most valuable for you?
1:1’s are most valuable for me when you take an active role in them. Using the time to surface challenges you’re facing, be open and honest about how you’re doing, where you need help, and where you want to go. 

### What are your work goals for the next 3 months? Next 12 months? 
Short term, my goal is to create clarity for the Design team at Buffer. Who we are as a team, what our charge is, and how, along with the other teams at Buffer, can we be great partners in change.  

Longer term, my goals are to grow a diverse and inclusive team, both through hiring and skills development. To build strong connections between Design and other teams, including Marketing, Product, Engineering and Advocacy, so that we can deliver better experiences for our customers and help Buffer succeed. 

### What do you need from your manager?
Clarity on our mid-to-long term goals, the trust, space and autonomy to execute on those goals, and clear, candid, and direct feedback on my progress towards those goals.

### What do you need from your team?
Please speak up whenever you’re feeling challenged, stressed, anxious, unclear or have an issue. Having a solution in mind is great, but know that I don’t expect it. It’s okay not to have all the answers. It’s not okay though to let issues go unaddressed. 

Challenge my ideas directly and openly. Tell me when I’m wrong – it happens a lot. I understand this will feel uncomfortable at first, but I’ll do my best to let you know how much it’s appreciated in the moment. 

### What do you need from your peers? (outside the team)
Help surface problems or challenges you think myself or my team may be able to help you with. 

Be open to having ideas challenged and debated. Design in particular is about solving problems. To be effective, that often means asking lots of questions to form a strong understanding first.

Involve Design as early in the process as you can. I promise we’ll work hard to avoid adding any stop energy to your project or initiative. 


## My expectations of folks who report to me

**I expect you to:**

- Invest in our 1:1s. Be prepared each week and give them your full attention and focus.
- Challenge my ideas directly and openly. Tell me when I’m wrong – it happens a lot. Yes, I’m repeating myself here because I think it’s that important. 
- Practice [disagreeing and committing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disagree_and_commit).
- Never stop learning and honing your craft. This includes design and communication. 
- Understand how the work we do supports our customer’s goals.
- Speak up whenever something feels off. 
- Check your ego at the door and separate your ideas from yourself.


## What you can expect of me as your manager

**You can expect:**

- Weekly 1:1s with me. I think this time is incredibly valuable and I’ll aim to never miss one. 
- Clarity around goals. I promise to set goals with you, so it’s always clear what’s expected of you and what good performance looks like. 
- No surprises. I’ll let you know when you’re doing well and when there’s room to improve. I’ll do this regularly, not just once or twice a year in a review, and I’ll be specific. 
- I will challenge you directly to grow and do the best work of your career. 
- I promise to deeply invest in your success and do everything I can to unlock opportunities for you at Buffer and elsewhere. 


## About me (and my cheat sheet…)

What if our friends, partners or bosses gave us a cheat sheet of their most basic principles, ideals or values at the start of our relationship? 

Not so we could make a snap judgment about them, but so that we’d have a clear understanding of how they operate and see the world. So that we could start our new relationship by taking a shared step in the right direction (instead of guessing or learning through trial and error). 

Can I share my cheat sheet with you? 

**Here it is:**

- I’m a pragmatist in the purest sense. 
- I often seek forgiveness instead of asking for permission. 
- I have many [strong opinions, weakly held](https://www.saffo.com/02008/07/26/strong-opinions-weakly-held/). 
- I respect those that challenge my ideas openly and directly.
- I believe in reasoning from [first principles](https://jamesclear.com/first-principles). 
- I’m firmly on the Ask end of [Ask vs Guess culture](https://slackhq.com/ask-vs-guess-culture-in-the-office) spectrum. 
- Want to go even deeper? I’m currently an [ENTJ](https://www.16personalities.com/entj-personality).
